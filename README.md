# Histogram-Equilization-and-Matching

<p>This was the first homework assignment for CS479: Computer Vision at Sonoma State University. This assignment was geared towards getting more familiar with the skimage and matplotlib python libraries. This was done by looking at images and their respective histograms. This was further studied by equalizing some of those histograms using the aforementioned libraries. </p>
